# tsp-opt
Source code for a Java application for my final high-school project about a few algorithms used to approximate a solution for the Travelling Salesman Problem.
It features an interface that allows the user to input the amount of points to be randomly generated on a canvas. Additionally, the solution to the complete graph that those dots would generate if treated as vertices can be approximated with the following algorithms:

* Check all solutions
* Genetic algorithm
* Full greedy algorithm
* Greedy algorithm
* 2-opt-tour
* Greedy + 2-opt-tour
* Simulated annealing
* Greedy algorithm + simulated annealing
